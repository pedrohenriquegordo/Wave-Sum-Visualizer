# WaveSumVisualizer
Explore the fascinating behavior of wave interactions with this script!

Witness the dynamic propagation of two sine waves - one along the x-axis and the other along the y-axis - as they merge and journey through the z-axis.
Designed for interactive learning, this tool allows users to effortlessly adjust the characteristics of each wave, providing an immersive experience
in understanding their individual and combined effects.
Watch as areas of maximum negative amplitude come alive in vivid blue,
while zones of peak positive amplitude glow in warm red.
The delicate balance at zero amplitude is elegantly marked by a soothing purple. Dive into this playful yet professional exploration of wave dynamics!
